what happens when we run any file in java

1. start jvm
2. create and start main thread
3. locate filename.calss file
4. load filename.class file (static varible creation)
5. execute main method
6.unload filanem.class file (static varibles destruction)
7.terminate main thread
8. shutdown the jvm

static varibles are stored in method area they are also known as fields
local var stored in stack memeory 
instance varible are also known as attributes or object level varible



instance varible and static varible are not thread safe because multiple thread 
can access them simontaneously and local varible are thread safe

every varible in java is either 
instance primitive 
instance reference

static primitive 
static reference

local primitive
local reference


example 
class Test 
    int x = 10 // instance primitve
    static String s = "faraz"; // static reference
    main()
            int[] y = new int[3] // local reference


1.7 java -> interface -> public abstract
java 8 -> interface can contain method with body but you have to 
use default keyword
