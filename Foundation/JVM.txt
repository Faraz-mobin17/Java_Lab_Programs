what happens when we run any file in java

1. start jvm
2. create and start main thread
3. locate filename.calss file
4. load filename.class file (static varible creation)
5. execute main method
6.unload filanem.class file (static varibles destruction)
7.terminate main thread
8. shutdown the jvm

static varibles are stored in method area
local var stored in stack memeory
